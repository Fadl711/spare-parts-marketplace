Walkthrough: App Stability & Error Fixes
I have successfully resolved the critical application errors and implemented a robust safety layer to prevent future crashes.

🛠 Fixes Implemented
1. Fixed "Render Error: Cannot read property 'map' of undefined"
Target: 
src/screens/customer/PartDetailsScreen.tsx
Solution: Rewrote the component to include strict safety checks for all data properties (images, vehicles, 
seller
).
Validation: The screen now gracefully handles missing data (e.g., missing images) without crashing.
2. Global Safety Net (ErrorBoundary)
Target: 
src/components/ErrorBoundary.tsx
 & 
App.tsx
Solution: Created a global error handler that wraps the entire app.
Benefit: Instead of a confusing "Red Screen of Death" or white screen, users will see a friendly "Something went wrong" message with a "Retry" button if an unexpected error occurs.
3. Type System Unification
Target: 
src/types/index.ts
 & 
src/services/api.ts
Solution: Aligned frontend TypeScript interfaces with the actual Backend API responses.
Added status, images structure, and optional fields to 
Part
.
Updated ApiService to include missing methods (getFeaturedParts, getMakes) required by the Home Screen.
4. User Experience Improvements
Home Screen: Added "Pull to Refresh" and fixed data loading issues.
Favorites Screen: Implemented full API integration, "Pull to Refresh", and a nice empty state.
Search Results: Fixed potential crash when accessing image URLs and added empty state.
🔍 How to Verify
Reload the App: shake the device or press r in the terminal to reload.
Navigate to Home: Ensure "Featured Parts" load correctly. Pull down to refresh.
View a Part: Tap any part. It should open 
PartDetailsScreen
 without error.
Check Favorites: Go to the Favorites tab. It should show your favorites or a "No favorites yet" message (not a blank screen).
Test Stability: The app should now be resilient to data inconsistencies.
⚠️ Notes
Orders Screen: This screen is currently not linked in the navigation, so I focused on fixing the active screens (
Home
, 
Favorites
, 
Search
, 
Details
).
Lint Errors: You may still see some "red squiggles" in the editor (related to 
tsconfig.json
 settings), but these are configuration warnings and should not prevent the app from running safely.
